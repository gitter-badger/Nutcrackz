If you encounter a warning / error when loading png images into the Skybox creator,
then what you need to do is to go to this website:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmt/files/pngcrush-executables/

and download the latest .exe file!
NOTE! it has to end with .exe and not .exe.asc!

And after that you need to put into a folder and create a .bat file from a text editor (i used notepad)
and in that .bat file you need to put this code in it:

For /R %%i in (*.png) do PNGCRUSH.EXE -ow -rem allb -reduce %%i

From start to finish of the line above, that is what you need to put into the .bat file in order to fix your .png files,
so they no longer provide that stupid warning / error!

Oh btw, you need to put your png files from the skybox folder you wish to use, into the same folde as the pngcrush.exe and your .bat file :)

Cheers,
David.
