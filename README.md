Nutcrackz Game Engine - A custom made OpenGL Game Engine made in C++

Nutcrackz is an open source custom game engine, that is aiming to include 2D game engine, 3D game engine and script editor into one,
much like Leadwerks, Unity and such game engines, except this is totally customized with OpenGL only (currently!).

The engines editor is it it's very basics, but i hope i can keep on adding more and more features :)

Currently (since it's so basic atm) you can create Lua scripts (script integration into the 2D/3D editors are still a wip!),
and you can create 2D projects (the editor is very buggy atm so you can just see the editors interface atm),
and lastly you can create 3D projects (which is where i have gotten furthest currently!).

The script editor works with small bugs.
The 2D editor has severe bugs which is where i will continue my work for some time, to fix those bugs.
The 3D editor is still very buggy too, but you can move by using WASD and look around holding right mouse button down and moving the mouse at the same time.
The 3D editor also has simple import features by using AssImp, and that means that you can currently add static 3D models.

There is also a custom made Audio Engine, using SDL2, which works for both the 2D & 3D editors!

I am also in the works of making a Player (game player for testing outside the Editors!).

Please also note that currently the editors cannot use any kinds of playback mode, but that is scheduled for future updates!

Lastly you can also save 3D editor information to a file, and so can you with the built-in Lua editor!

If you're interested in collaborating then please don't hesitate on contacting me, which you can do at davidmortensen1 at me.com.

Thanks for your interest :)
